This is my portfolio website built using React. It showcases my projects, skills, and experience.

## Technologies Used

## Getting Started

To get started, you can clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/[Your Username]/[Your Repository Name].git

Then, navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies:

cd [Your Repository Name]
npm install

To run the project, use the following command:

npm start

This will start the development server and open the website in your browser.

## Deployment

To deploy the website, you can use GitHub Pages. First, create a new branch called `gh-pages`:

git checkout -b gh-pages

Then, build the website using the following command:

npm run build

This will create a `build` directory with the production-ready files. Commit and push the changes to the `gh-pages` branch:

git add .
git commit -m "Deploy website"

Finally, go to your repository's settings on GitHub and select `gh-pages` as the source for your GitHub Pages deployment.
